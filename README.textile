Automatic building and reporting to campfire of metrics with metric_fu through integrity.

h2. Features

* Generates an entire metric_fu site for you based on your integrity projects
* Notifies campfire of metric stats given that they have changed since the last run
* Calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle

h2. Requirements

* An Integrity setup.
* metric_fu
* tinder

h2. Usage

Run @rake generate@.

It's probably best to do this on a cron job.

h2. Setup

Have a config.yml file in your pythagoras directory with the following info:

<pre>

# This is the path to integrity's config.yml file.
integrity_config: /home/ci/integrity/config.yml

# Where you want the site to be placed that metric_fu creates
site: /home/ci/pythagoras/_site

# A regular expression for project names you wish to ignore
ignore: '[^shoulda]|1\.9'

# The location of your site, for campfire reporting
url: http://metrics.thoughtbot.com

# Set to true if you would like to skip notifying campfire when metrics have changed
skip_notification: false
</pre>
