* Support multiple builds per day
* Labels seems to be broken (JavaScript graphs)
* The header for reports is wrong ("metrics | 6")
  Because it's build 6, but should be the name of the project
* URL generation (Work fine without a subdomain)
  * GradedNotifier generates URLs in a weird way
  * views use hardcoded URLs
* Improve the check if a project exists
  * First test is ugly
    * Should also check if index.html exists, and if not, display a message that it's currently building
* Better (any) documentation
* Update (rewrite) the tests
* Process events in the background
  * Grade
  * Notifications
* Error handling for notifications
  Might be partially fixed by processing in the background, if we have a queue with retries
* Pack it up as a gem?
* Update the Rakefile
  * Make it possible to build a single project from the command-line
  * Make it possible to build all projects
