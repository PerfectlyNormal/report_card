    So... you don't know the password? Hmm... You can
    %a{ :href => path("/login") } try again
    or
    = succeed "." do
      %a{ :href => root_path, :rel => "home" } go back

    %dt What can I do?
    %dd
      This just means that you can't access some part of this
      server, but that shouldn't let you out of some of the
      %a{ :href => root_path } good-looking metrics
      hosted here. If this was just a misunderstanding and you
      %strong do
      have a password, then
      = succeed "." do
        %a{ :href => path("/login") } click here to try again
